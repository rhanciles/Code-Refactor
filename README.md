# Code Refactor

## Description
After completing my first week as a ‘BootCamp’ student, I have been given the challenge to go through the code of this page using ‘Scout Rule’ and ‘Agile Project Management’ principles. My brief is this: A marketing agency wants to improve the accessibility standards on their site and I have been given the privilege to do just that. _“Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website”. (edx, quoted from my brief)._ Using HTML Semantic Elements, is one of the best ways to achieve this and I hope I do justice to it.

## Usage
This repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. It contains a folder with an image of the webpage as it looks before the changes were applied alongside the original code files. I have added comments to all the relevant sections to highlight the modifications, although the semantic HTML elements makes some of it self-explanatory.  The content comprise only that related to the challenge; all other materials are removed for obvious reasons.

## Feedback
Please feel free to reach out or drop a comment here if you have any questions, queries or suggestions. Otherwise, you can find me on the Slack platform Pod 5, just search for Rod.
